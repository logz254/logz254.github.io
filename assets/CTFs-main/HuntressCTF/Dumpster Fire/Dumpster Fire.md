We found all this data in the dumpster! Can you find anything interesting in here, like any cool passwords or anything? Check it out quick before the foxes get to it!

## Solution
Extract the contents of the file and you are presented with several directories for a linux machine.

The juicy information for the challenge is found in the **home** directory -> **challenge** folder.

The information found here is for a Mozilla Firefox User Profile (**bc1m1zlr.default-release**). On realizing this, I had an idea that the flag would be found in the Saved Passwords. To view the Saved Passwords, you need to create a profile then copy+paste the files in **bc1m1zlr.default-release** into the newly created profile.

For information on how to create a profile in Mozilla FireFox, refer to this link: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-remove-switch-firefox-profiles#w_manage-profiles-when-firefox-is-open

In this case, I created a profile called **huntress**.

Navigate to the **Root Directory**. The contents of the folder are shown below:

Copy the files from **bc1m1zlr.default-release** folder and paste the files into **rs4hb5o5.huntress** folder

Go back to the browser and click on **Launch profile in new browser**

Navigate to **Passwords** and you get credentials for localhost running on port 31337. Unhiding the password, you get the flag.

flag{35446041dc161cf5c9c325a3d28af3e3}

After this, you can delete the newly created profile.
