The screenshot above shows a part of how it should look like after analysis is done.

3. Read through the rest of the analysis. When you get to the **Strings** section, you find a variable called **check_guess** with a base64 encoded value.

4. Base64 decode the value. You get **BSidesNBI{this_didn't_kill_them}**
