## Question
Author: @JohnHammond

They say you aren't supposed to judge a book by its cover, but this is one of my favorites!
File:[book.rar](/assets/CTFs-main/HuntressCTF/Book By Its Cover/book.rar)

## Solution
Just as the title of the challenge suggested, the file is indeed not a rar file but a PNG file.
I came to this conclusion after checking the file type.

Opening the file using any image viewer of your choice, you get the flag.
