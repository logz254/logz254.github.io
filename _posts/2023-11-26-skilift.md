## Question
You arrive at the base station of a ski lift. Unfortunately for you, the lift is not in operation but you have to reach the next summit somehow. You enter the control room to find a control terminal with the words "Please input your key:"

## Solution
1. Check out the provided file.
2. Reading through the code, you realize that there are a series of operations performed on the input key to generate a lock signal. The operations are:

   (i) Stage 1 takes the input key and performs a bitwise AND operation with 64'hF0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0.<br />
   (ii) Stage 2 performs a bitwise left shift (<<<) by 5 on the result of Stage 1.<br />
   (iii) Stage 3 performs a bitwise XOR (^) operation with the constant value "HACKERS!".<br />
   (iv) Stage 4 subtracts 12345678 from the result obtained in Stage 3.<br />
   (v) the lock output is determined by checking if tmp4 matches the value 64'h5443474D489DFDD3.

3. To solve this, you need to reverse the operations that are occuring.
4. Check out [**solv.py**](/assets\CTFs-main\GlacierCTF\Skilift\solv.py), it does this for you. On running the script, you get the input key i.e., 0xe0102030604060
5. Use the input key to get the flag.
