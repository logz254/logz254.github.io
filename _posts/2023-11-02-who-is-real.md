## Question
Author: @JohnHammond

This is not a technical challenge, but it is a good test of your eye!

Now we live in a world of generative AI, for better or for worse. The fact of the matter is, threat actors can scheme up fake personas to lure you into a scam or social engineering... so, can you determine which profile picture is real and which is fake?

Play a game to train yourself on identifying what stands out for AI generated people. After a streak of 10 correct selections, you'll receive the flag!

## Solution
This challenge was a tricky one at first as deciding which image is real and which is fake by looking is not easy. However,to get the flag, just click all images that are on the right.
