## Question
Cannot recall what the question was ðŸ˜…
## Solution

1. Download the provided APK i.e. [whatslif3.apk](/assets/CTFs-main/BSidesCTF/whatslif3/whatslif3.apk)
2. Fire up MobSF to get an analysis of the apk file.

The screenshot above shows a part of how it should look like after analysis is done.

3. Read through the rest of the analysis. When you get to the **Strings** section, you find a variable called **check_guess** with a base64 encoded value.

4. Base64 decode the value. You get **BSidesNBI{this_didn't_kill_them}**

7. From the text "Find a good recipe to cook your flag", I realised that CyberChef could be the solution and indeed it was.
